Checkpoint of work to support PCI devices.

These bits should eventually live in the NetBSD tree, as there shouldn't
be anything strictly specific to Xen.

(I haven't committed all the bits yet, so don't expect things to compile.
However, when I do managed to get everything from my working tree
committed, things will not only compile, they will also work.)
